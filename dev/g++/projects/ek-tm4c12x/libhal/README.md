## Introduction ##
The name libhal stands for library for Hardware Abstract Layer. The idea is to prpvide the same interface for all my electronic hardware (Linux base hardware or Baremetal hardware)


## How to build the project ##


## Hardware testing ##
The hardware testing is a special hardware used to validate embedded development.
This hardware provides test capabilities for both Digital and analog testing. It provides also diffrerent kind of sensors..

### 1. Digital testing ###
Digital testing includes:
    * LED switch on/off
    * Interrupt checking, debouncing...
    * external interrupt
    * Transistor command

### 2. Analog testing ###
    * ADC testing capability
    * DAC testing capability

### Sensors capabilities ###
    * Gyroscope, Accelerometer
    * Hall effect
    *
