This file contains the todo list regarding my different projects.

## Staff on libhal project
The main objective is to validate the libhal concept on my different hardwares, starting with Baremetal hardware (TI launchpad).
The next step will be to develop the same libhal concept on my Linux hardwares.

In the same time, I will develop a test card to validate this libhal concept. This hardware should provide test capabilities for both Digital and analog testing. It provides also diffrerent kind of sensors..

### Digital testing

Digital testing includes: * LED switch on/off * Interrupt checking, debouncing... * external interrupt * Transistor command

###  Analog testing

* ADC testing capability
* DAC testing capability

### Sensors capabilities

* Gyroscope, Accelerometer
* Hall effect
* 

## Developement of common embedded peaces of code for Linux based hardware
The main objective is to basic lightweight software libraries such as logging, communication, NMEA support and so on for my different Linux based hardwares 

## GoogleTest Framework support

* Rebuild framework with ARM compiler
* Apply it to LaunchPad TM4C


That's all folks
